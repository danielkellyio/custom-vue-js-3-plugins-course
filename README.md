Plugins allow you to quickly install advanced functionality to your Vue.js applications. Officially maintained plugins include [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for global state management and [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) for single page app route support. 

Plugins are often provided by 3rd parties on npm to support a large variety of plug-and-play functionality. [Floating Vue](https://floating-vue.starpad.dev/) is a fast way to implement tooltips and other floating UI elements. Full UI libraries like [Prime Vue](https://www.primefaces.org/primevue/) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com) are also Vue.js plugins.

Interested in building your own custom plugins? Look no further! In this course you'll learn everything you need to know! Build a **custom tooltip plugin** and learn how to define a plugin, register components, provide global properties and methods, use provide/inject, accept plugin options, and more!
